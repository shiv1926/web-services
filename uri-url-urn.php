What is the difference between URI, URL and URN? 
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name or a resource on the Internet. A URI has two specializations known as URL and URN.
URL -- Uniform Resource Locator
Contains information about how to fetch a resource from its location. For example:

http://example.com/mypage.html
ftp://example.com/download.zip
mailto:user@example.com
file:///home/user/file.txt
http://example.com/resource?foo=bar#fragment
/other/link.html (A relative URL, only useful in the context of another URL)
URLs always start with a protocol (http) and usually contain information such as the network host name (example.com) and often a document path (/foo/mypage.html). URLs may have query parameters and fragment identifiers.
